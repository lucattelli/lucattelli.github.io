    </header><p>A pragmatic programmer must be learning new things, constantly. A new programming language per year is a good average according to the PragProg book. After you decided you’ll learn a new language, the important question is: which language?</p>
<p>Maybe you can start with a language that’s similar to the ones you already know. That’s a good start. But once you’re starting to form this new habit, <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.paulgraham.com/weird.html">try learning languages that are weird to you</a>.</p>
<p>More valuable than learning how to solve similar problems using different languages is actually learning about problems you’re not familiar with that these weird languages aim to solve. Expanding your knowledge about approaches and design ideas will help you write better code.</p>
